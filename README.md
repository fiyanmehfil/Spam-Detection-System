# Spam-Detection-System

## Overview
This project is designed to identify spam messages through the implementation of machine learning techniques. Natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms are applied to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.

## Table of Contents
1. **Importing Libraries**
   - The project begins by importing essential libraries that facilitate data manipulation, machine learning, and natural language processing.

2. **Dataset**
   - Describes the dataset used for training and testing the spam message detection model.

3. **Loading and Exploring Data**
   - Involves loading the dataset into the program and exploring its structure and characteristics.

4. **Preparing Data**
   - Steps taken to prepare the data for model training and testing.

   a. *Splitting the Data into Training Set and Testing Set*
      - The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

   b. *Tokenization*
      - Tokenization is applied to convert text into individual tokens or words, a crucial step in natural language processing.

   c. *Sequencing and Padding on Training and Testing*
      - The sequences of tokens are generated and padded to ensure a consistent input length for the model.

5. **Testing the Classifier on User Input**
   - Allows the user to input a message, and the trained classifier predicts whether it is spam or not.

   a. The user is prompted to input a message.
   
   b. The input is processed and evaluated by the trained model.
   
   c. The result is displayed, indicating whether the message is classified as spam or not.

## Notes
- Ensure that the specified dataset (e.g., `spam_dataset.csv`) is available for use.
- Parameters and file names may need adjustments based on your specific implementation.
